                            <p>The objective was to design and build a simple lightweight truss from aluminium alloy to support the load conditions. The first load condition is an upwards load of 270 N, the second load is a downwards load of 2700 N, both at a distance 815mm out from the rigid plate. The load rod is 115 mm across and requires two 10mm holes for the M10 bolts either side</p>
                            <img style='height: 100%; width: 50%; object-fit: contain' src="../assets/images/SDP/problem.png" alt="" /></a>
                            <h3>Design process</h3>
                            <p>Some early inspiration for the shape of our truss was taken from cranes. Having a very
                                similar load condition, it made sense to analyse the warren truss that are commonly used in
                                modern cranes. However, these are generally in a slanted triangle shape which is much
                                harder to make with the shape of the rigid plate.
                                A topology optimisation simulation was done on SOLIDWORKS with the goal of best stiffness
                                to weight ratio. The shape produced resembles the warren truss and so we decided that
                                was the one we were going to use.
                                </p>
                            <img style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' src="../assets/images/SDP/study.png" alt="" width=1000 height = 300/></a>
                            <p>The curves in the output shape mean that its extremely difficult to recreate in the
                                aluminium angle iron and plate so we copied the rough shape of the truss. After briefly
                                considering a triangular truss it was decided to simplify the warren truss above. The number
                                of central members were decreased by changing it to a Œõ shape, rather than having it as an
                                M. This made it easier for calculations and construction and means that the geometry is only
                                defined by the angle at A.</p>
                            <img style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain' src="../assets/images/SDP/rough.png" alt="" /></a>
                            <p>From inspection of the compression members are BD and CD. Aluminium alloy is strong in
                                tension and weak in compression as it is more susceptible to buckling than plastically
                                deforming though tension. The Euler critical buckling load also depends on the length of the
                                beam squared as seen in equation below.</p>
                            <img style='height: 100%; width: 20%; object-fit: contain' src="../assets/images/SDP/euler.png" alt="" /></a>
                            <p>By finding the compression multiplied by length squared of both compression members as functions of Œ∏, then differentiating it, 
                                equating it to zero and then solving for ùúÉ, it is possible to find the optimum angle to prevent Euler buckling. </p>
                            <p>For member BD This was found to be </p>
                            <img style='height: 100%; width: 60%; object-fit: contain' src="../assets/images/SDP/BD.png" alt="" /></a>
                            <p> Which substituting values into the equation, the optimum angle is at a minimum at ùúÉ = 17.4¬∞ </p>
                            <p> For member CD This was found to be </p>
                            <img style='height: 100%; width: 30%; object-fit: contain' src="../assets/images/SDP/CD.png" alt="" /></a>
                            <p> The buckling stress in CD decreases the closer ùúÉ is to 90¬∞ and so to minimise both
                                we picked a value of ùúÉ = 35¬∞. We also added some zero force members close to the middle
                                of BD and CD to further minimise the buckling and also some diagonal members to prevent twisting and outwards buckling. This was the final profile.</p>
                            <img style='height: 100%; width: 70%; object-fit: contain' src="../assets/images/SDP/isometric.png" alt="" /></a>
                            <p>To minimise weight, efforts were made to use the lightest alloy members of minimum crosssectional area that can support the load. Using a factor of safety of about 1.1 the load is
                                3000ùëÅ, which gives ùëä = 1500 N on each side. Each member‚Äôs effective load is found
                                using pin joint analysis and is divided by the maximum stress, 255 ùëÄùëÉùëé, which gives the
                                minimum effective cross-sectional area required to withstand the tensile loads.
                                The member with an effective area as close to, but greater than the
                                minimum area required is selected. The effective area accounts for the rivit hole and
                                ignores a section of the angle iron that does not provide tensile support. </p>
                            <p>For compression members, their mode of failure is from buckling, where the member bows
                                out. The critical buckling stress decreases rapidly as slenderness ratio, the ratio of the beam's length over
                                width, increases. After some initial calculations it was obvious compression
                                of any member either needed doubling up, or cross bracing. Doubling up members
                                constrains the beams to buckle in a different mode, however after trying many
                                combinations of members and comparing them to braced members it was found that
                                bracing is far more cost effective. Bracing works by adding equally spaced zero force
                                members along the compression member which can halve for third the slenderness, greatly
                                decreasing the chances of buckling. So, for the compression members we need to ensure that they are braced enough that the
                                compressive stress is less than the critical buckling stress while the beam is as slender as possible. The
                                diagonal and buckling bracing are made from 9.5 angle as they are zero force members. </p>
                            <p>For the number of rivets at each joint their maximum shear failure load is 1260 N and so the minimum number of rivets
                                required can be calculated, from rounding up and in some cases using an extra one to be on
                                the cautionary side as rivets are cheap and don't add much weight to the structure.</p>

                            <h3>Construction</h3>

                            <p>The side of the gusset plate that attached the truss to the back plate hung off the
                                edge. While this isn't a problem for the top tensile load, it's a problem for the
                                compressive load as gusset plates easily buckle. </p>
                            <p>The whole structure was slightly twisted, which was somewhat corrected for by
                                using packing washers behind the bottom left gusset plate that attached to the back
                                plate. This was likely caused by one of the beams on one side being the incorrect
                                length. </p>
                            <p>In 9.5 and 12.5 angle irons, the rivets were on the line of the beam's centroid. In
                                many cases the rivets were off their line due to the centre punch being very difficult
                                to accurately place.
                                </p>
                            
                            <h3>Testing</h3>

                            <video width="640" height="480" controls>
                                <source src="../assets/images/SDP/testing.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                              Your browser does not support the video tag.
                              </video>
                            <p> A small amount of buckling was observed at the working load, but major type A buckling
                                occurred sideways in CD and a some in BD while loaded above the working load. However,
                                before it could deform plasticly, the upper left gusset plate sheared, likely due to the large
                                deflections.</p>
                            <p>The truss was first tested with the 270N upwards force, which it easily supported. It was
                                then loaded up to a working load of 1.35kN with no visible deformation, it was then loaded
                                up to a maximum load of 1.83kN before breaking. This makes it 68% of designed load was
                                achieved</p>
                            
                            <h3>Future Modifications</h3>

                            <p>A sideways cross member was required to prevent the buckling, something our group, and a
                                few others had overlooked in the 3D truss design. It is likely that the upper plate gusset
                                shearing was due to the larger deflections caused by the buckling and the sideways cross
                                member would take is closer to the designed load. The deviations in construction weren‚Äôt
                                severe enough to cause an unexpected failure at the load that was achieved, however it
                                could have at a higher load so more care should be taken to reduce these deviations.</p>

                            <h3>Final Remarks</h3>

                            <p>The truss was optimally designed to reduce buckling stress in only the side
                                plane, and not the horizontal plane, and so members CD just buckled sideways. It was
                                predicted from the calculations that the truss would fail due to buckling, but not in the
                                plane that we considered. Our groups truss design was slightly under the average in terms
                                of cost and its performance, however with the modifications made I believe could perform
                                as expected by the calculations.</p>
