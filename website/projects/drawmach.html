	<h3>Design process</h3>
	<p>
		Like with many of my projects, I research the parts required, then purchase the parts that I cant make myself.
		I then search for the parts CAD files on the internet or create them myself and design the fittings and attachments to them.
		For the arrangement of linear rails and stepper motors, I decided to use a H shape belt which meant the moving frame was as light
		as possible, meaning it could move a lot faster. This design was partly inspired by the youtuber StuffMadeHere in his <a href="https://youtu.be/myO8fxhDRW0">video</a>
		I had to make 3D files of all the parts except the Arduino in the renders seen below.
